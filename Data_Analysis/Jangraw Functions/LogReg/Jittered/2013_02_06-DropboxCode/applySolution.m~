function applySolution(ALLEEG,v,prior,scope_settings)

% Apply a known set of spatial and temporal weights to given data.

% applySolution(ALLEEG,v,prior,scope_settings)
%
% INPUTS:
% -ALLEEG is a 2-element vector of eeglab data structs.  ALLEEG(1) is 
%  distractor trials, and ALLEEG(2) is target trials.  
% -v is the set of spatial weights you want applied to the data. v is an 
%  n+1 element vector, where n is the number of channels.
% -prior is a matrix of the jitter priors you want applied to the data.
%  prior is an m x k matrix, where m is the number of trials (distractors 
%  first, then targets) and k is the number of time points.
% -scope_settings is a struct determining the scope of data used, as in
%  run_logisticregression_jittered_EM_saccades().  It must contain fields
%  trainingwindowlength, trainingwindowinterval, and trainingwindowrange.
