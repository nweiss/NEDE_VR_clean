function D = sumprior(prior,trainingwindowlength)

% Calculate the sum of a prior over a shifting training window.
%
% D = sumprior(prior,trainingwindowlength)
% 
% INPUTS:
% -prior is an n-element vector, where n is the assumed limit for jitter on
% a trial (including positive and negative jitters).  prior = 
% p(t_i|x_i,y_i,v) for the current iteration of logistic regression, where 
% t=jitter, x=data, y=truth, and v=spatial weights.
% -trainingwindowlength is the number of samples in each training window -
% that is, the width of the window over which we want to take a sum.
% 
% OUTPUTS:
% -D is a vector with n+2*(trainingwindowlength-1) elements.  It contains
% the sum over the training window at that particular jitter.  The first
% element should equal prior(1), and the last should equal prior(end).
