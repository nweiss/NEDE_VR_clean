You are a soldier on patrol.  Your car navigates by itself, but you are in charge of the brakes. 

When the truck in front of you puts on its brake lights, hit your brakes as fast as possible by pressing the A button on the gamepad.

Your car won't actually slow down - your action just signals the car in front of you to speed up again.

On this patrol, you've heard that there may be bombs hidden in boxes with <targetString> on them.

At the end of the patrol, you will be asked to report the number of <targetString> boxes that you saw to the bomb squad.

Do not press any buttons or say anything out loud when you see the boxes - instead, try to stay perfectly still and just count internally.
